# Long shutdowns of neutron sources

ISIS has just started a long shutdown period during which part of the LINAC will be replaced, as well as the TS1 target, reflector and moderator (TRAM) assembly. TS2 will return to operations on the 1st of March 2022, while TS1 will return for commissioning in the summer of 2022, with first user experiments in September 2022. The next ISIS proposal round in the autumn will be for TS2 instruments only.   To see news and progress on the ISIS long shutdown work, [see here] (https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ShutdownUpdate.aspx) 
In October, the ILL will be embarking on its “ILL20-23” programme of maintenance and upgrade work, including replacement of the H1-H2 beam tube (which delivers neutrons to the main guide hall). This will mean a long shutdown of the ILL reactor till around the end of 2022.  There will (like at ISIS) be no proposal round in autumn 2021.  
SINQ will be running during these shutdown periods, with the next proposal deadline there being the 15th November for period I/22 - first half of 2022. However, the FRM-II reactor at MLZ is still shutdown with problems with the cold source there. They hope to restart operations in the autumn.

# ISIS Neutron & Muon Source – Endeavour Programme User Meetings

Endeavour is the programme of new instruments and large instrument upgrades at ISIS. It consists of around 9 projects which aim to enhance ISIS’ capability to deliver science in three key areas: clean growth; biosciences and health; materials for the future. Three user meetings were held in July (via Zoom) under these three topics, to give updates to the community on the instrument projects and to get feedback on the projects and the new science they will enable. At each meeting, the instrument projects were presented by a user community ‘champion’, and the projects were then discussed in breakout sessions. Over 230 people attended across the three meetings, and there were good discussions on the projects. The instrument talks are available on the [ISIS website] (https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/News21_EndeavourMeetings.aspx), and a report from the meetings will be available soon.

# Postgraduate representative on Faraday Division Council

Faraday Division is committed to supporting physical chemists of all career stages, and we are now seeking candidates for a postgraduate representative on the Division Council. 
This is a fantastic opportunity to gain experience and get involved with the RSC at a national level. The successful applicant will be responsible for representing the views of postgraduate researchers, and will play a major role in the development of Faraday Division's strategy and activities.
If you are a postgraduate researcher, please consider if you’d like to contribute to the work of the Division in this way. We are committed to promoting inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity in its widest sense, and welcome applications from candidates of all backgrounds with the relevant experience. 
More information, including the eligibility criteria, can be found on the application form. The deadline is Monday 16 August. Please share this with students who might be interested in the position.

# NSG Secretary position available

The committee of the NSG is currently looking for a new Secretary. Kathi Edkins is coming to the end of her term and will step down at the end of the year. If you would like to support the committee and the user community in this position, please [apply here](https://www.mi-nomination.com/iop/form/NominationGroup). Self-nominations are welcome from any member of the IOP or RSC.

# ISIS Studentship Call

The 2021 call for ISIS Facility Development and Utilisation studentships is now open. This is a 50% ISIS funded Studentship which includes an element of facility development - for example, some sample environment kit or in-situ measurement rig, or perhaps analysis or modelling software.   [Go to here](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/2021-Call-for-studentships.aspx for further details).

# 25th IUCr Congress – August 14-22nd

The 25th IUCr Congress starts soon, running between August 14th until August 22nd. Please [see the website](https://iucr25.org/)for further details: 

# Principles of neutron scattering from condensed matter

A new book, "Principles of neutron scattering from condensed matter" by Andrew Boothroyd, is out and may be of interest to the community. [visit this] (https://global.oup.com/academic/product/principles-of-neutron-scattering-from-condensed-matter-9780198862314?cc=gb&lang=en&).

# STFC Air Quality Network (SAQN)

Neutron Spectroscopy will be used as a high resolution spectroscopic technique to assess the potential health and climate impacts of biomass burning aerosol and help to improve air quality. A number of projects have been funded recently by STFC Air Quality Network (SAQN) in this area. This is a concerted effort to counter climate change and improve air quality in collaboration with ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, Central Laser Facility, Diamond, Public Health England and a number of UK Universities. More information will be found [here](https://www.saqn.org/2021/06/29/saqn-funds-new-research-into-air-quality/)

# Get in touch

Do you have a news item that you would like to see included in this newsletter? Are you advertising for PhD or PDRA position in the field of neutron scattering? Have you just defended your PhD and want the community to know about this? Have you been to a conference or published/read a book or chapter or paper that is of interest to the neutron scattering community? Then get in touch with a short description of the item at committee@ukneutron.org and we will include the item in the newsletter for the following month as well as publicize on our [webpage](http://ukneutron.org) and through our Twitter account @ukneutron.
