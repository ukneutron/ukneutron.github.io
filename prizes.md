## BTM Willis Prize

The BTM Willis Prize is awarded annually by the UK Neutron Scattering Group (NSG) in recognition of outstanding research in neutron scattering sciences by an early-career researcher. 
The Prize is named in honour of Prof. B. Terrence (Terry) M. Willis, a pioneer in the development and teaching of neutron scattering in the UK and founder of the NSG. 
The BTM Willis Prize is awarded to an individual for an outstanding body of work in the application or development of neutron scattering to a significant problem in the physical sciences, life science or engineering. 
The BTM Willis Prize is open to nominees based in the UK or Ireland only. Nominees should be an early-career scientist, typically with no more than 10 years of full-time equivalent professional experience.

## Don McKenzie Paul Thesis Prize

The Don McKenzie Paul Thesis Prize is awarded biennially by the UK NSG in recognition of an outstanding PhD thesis in which the use or development of neutron scattering is instrumental in addressing a current scientific challenge. 
The prize is named in honour of Prof. Don McKenzie Paul (1953 â€“ 2019), a leading condensed matter scientist and professor at the University of Warwick. 
Throughout his career, Don was a well-known and highly regarded research leader in neutron scattering sciences and an active ambassador and advocate for the community.  
Further information on Prof. Don McKenzie Paul and his research [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10448632.2020.1731292).

Nominations can be made on behalf of candidates who have successfully submitted and defended a PhD thesis within the last 24 months of the nomination deadline. 
To be eligible for the prize, nominators must confirm that their nominee has had any thesis corrections approved and that the recommendation for award of a PhD degree has been made by the thesis examiners.
The degree awarding institution must be based in the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland.

## Thomas Penfold Poster Prize

The Thomas Penfold Prize is awarded annually to the best student poster presentation showcasing work using neutron scattering at Neutron and Muon Science Users Meeting (NMSUM). 
Each year, the judging panel is made up of members of the NSG committee and plenary speakers from the NMSUM conference.
