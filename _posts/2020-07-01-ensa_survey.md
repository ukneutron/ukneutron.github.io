Dear Neutron User,
 
I approach you on behalf of the European Neutron Scattering Association (http://neutrons-ensa.eu/). 
This year we are preparing a survey to investigate the needs of European scientists using neutrons for their research, which will feed into our collaborative work with BrightnESS-2 and LENS. 
In the attached files ([file 1](./../assets/ensa_1.pdf) and [file 2](./../ensa_2.pdf)) you can find some background information about this investigation as well as a small presentation describing the context of our approach.
 
In order to ascertain the success of the investigation, we would like to ask for your help. 
You can help by uploading PDFs of your published work, both "neutron" and "non-neutron" publications via the following link:
 
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/HLBG4gzMgLekGSz (password on request from committee@ukneutron.org).
 
The aforementioned upload server for your PDFs or zip-files of PDFs is our academic cloud server "surf.nl" since this work is executed at TU Delft, NL.
 
Should you have any questions regarding the investigation, or our approach, please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
With best regards,
ENSA and your national ENSA delegate (Dave Barlow)
