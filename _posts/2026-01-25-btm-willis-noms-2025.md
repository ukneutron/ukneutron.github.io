The BTM Willis Prize is awarded annually by the UK Neutron Scattering Group to an early-career researcher for an outstanding body of work in the application or development of neutron scattering to a significant problem in the physical sciences, life science or engineering.  The Prize is named in honour of Prof. B. T. M. (Terry) Willis (1927-2018), a pioneer in the development and teaching of neutron scattering in the UK and founder of the UK Neutron Scattering Group.
 
The BTM Willis Prize is open to nominees based in the UK or Ireland only. Nominees should be an early-career scientist, typically with no more than 10 years of full-time equivalent professional experience. This should be experience gained as part of a scientific career excluding time spent in full-time education, i.e., time spent as a postgraduate student should not be included. Time spent as a post-doctoral researcher should be included. 
  
Career breaks will be taken into consideration, and applications are particularly encouraged from those whose career has spanned a break due to caring responsibilities or personal circumstances, e.g., a period of parental/adoption leave, family commitments, illness, or other exceptional circumstances.

Nominees must be available to present the BTM Willis Prize lecture at NMSUM (Neutron and Muon Science and User Meeting) at the University of Warwick on the 14th and 15th April 2026.
