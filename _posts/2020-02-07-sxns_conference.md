The 16th International Conference on Surface X-ray and Neutron Scattering (SXNS16) is being held in Lund Sweden in late June this year. 

This conference will emphasize novel techniques for surface x-ray and neutron scattering including instrumentation and source development. 
Topics will include in-situ and in-operando surface studies, nanostructured surfaces and interfaces, surface and interfaces in soft matter, biological interfaces, emergent interfacial materials, and dynamics of surfaces, interfaces and nanostructures.
