On behalf of the IOP/RSC Neutron Scattering Group, the RSC Colloid and Interface Science Group and the SCI Colloid and Surface Chemistry Group, we invite you to participate in a set of two short online symposia on neutron scattering in colloid and interface science in May this year. 
Topics will include applications of small-angle neutron scattering in colloid science and applications of neutron reflectometry in interface science. 
In addition to presentations by invited speakers, there will be a presentation of the special interest groups as well as contributed talks in parallel sessions, and the event will finish with a panel discussion. 
The online format allows us to offer this as a free event to all, which will be broadly publicised to IOP, RSC and SCI members. 
There will be four invited speakers - Marité Cárdenas (Malmö), David Growney (Lubrizol), Alison Paul (Cardiff) and Stuart Clarke (Cambridge) - speaking on topics ranging from biophysics to drug delivery and industrial applications. 
Please register at [HERE](https://www.iopconferences.org/iop/1645/home) and note the abstract submission deadline of 26th March 2021 for contributed talks. 
All very welcome.
