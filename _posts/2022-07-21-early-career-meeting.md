The UK Neutron Scattering Group will host an Early Career Meeting on 10 and 11 November 2022. The meeting will take place in-person at The Cosener's House in Oxfordshire. Researchers from any background and on any career path who use neutron scattering in any form are welcome to attend, as long as they are early in their career (within 12 years of award of their final degree). The meeting will consist of networking with fellow neutron scatterers, career development activities and oral presentations from the participants.
