The Don McKenzie Paul Thesis Prize is awarded biennially by the UK Neutron Scattering Group (NSG) in recognition of an outstanding PhD thesis in which the use or development of neutron scattering is instrumental in addressing a current scientific challenge. The prize is named in honour of Prof. Don McKenzie Paul (1953 – 2019), a leading condensed matter scientist and professor at the University of Warwick. Throughout his career, Don was a well-known and highly regarded research leader in neutron scattering sciences and an active ambassador and advocate for the community.

Nominations can be made on behalf of candidates who have successfully defended a PhD thesis within the last 24 months of the nomination deadline (10th February 2025). The thesis must demonstrate outstanding and innovative use of neutron scattering methods and/or development of novel neutron instrumentation or techniques.  To be eligible for the prize, nominators must confirm that their nominee has had any thesis corrections approved and that the recommendation for award of a PhD degree has been made by the thesis examiners. The degree awarding institution must be based in the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland.
