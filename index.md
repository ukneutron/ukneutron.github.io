    The Neutron Scattering Group is a group of the Royal Society of Chemistry and the Institute of Physics.
    We hold the remit to represent UK users of neutron scattering techniques within these learned society.
    Additionally, we award the <a href="./willis">BTM Willis Prize</a> annually and were involved in the organisation of the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/news/events/faraday2017/">Faraday Joint Interest Group Conference</a> in 2017.</th>
