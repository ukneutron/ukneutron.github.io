The BTM Willis Prize is awarded annually by the UK Neutron Scattering Group (NSG) in recognition of 
outstanding research in neutron scattering sciences by an early-career researcher. 
The Prize is named in honour of Prof. B. T. M. (Terry) Willis (1927-2018), 
a pioneer in the development and teaching of neutron scattering in the UK and founder of the NSG. 
The BTM Willis Prize is awarded to an individual for an outstanding body of work in the application 
or development of neutron scattering to a significant problem in the physical sciences, 
life science or engineering. 

Nomination for the 2024 BTM Willis Prize is now closed.  **Deadline: 5 GMT (Thursday) 21st March 2024**

Prize announcement and lecture: 11th April, NMSUM 2024, University of Warwick

## Eligibility: 
The BTM Willis Prize is open to nominees based in the UK or Ireland only. 
Nominees should be an **early-career scientist**, typically with **no more than 10 years of full-time 
equivalent professional experience**. This should be experience gained as part of a scientific 
career excluding time spent in full-time education, i.e., time spent as a 
postgraduate student should not be included. Time spent as a post-doctoral researcher should be included. 

Career breaks will be taken into consideration, and **applications are particularly encouraged from those 
whose career has spanned a break** due to caring responsibilities or personal circumstances, e.g., 
a period of parental/adoption leave, family commitments, illness, or other exceptional circumstances.
Nominators will be asked to provide details of their nominee's professional experience 
in relation to the above criteria. The judging panel will consider this information in relation 
to the eligibility criteria, and they have the discretion to consider any nomination for a different 
prize under their remit.
Starting from the 2024 Prize, unsuccessful nominations will automatically rollover to the next year, 
unless the nominee’s circumstances have changed to make them ineligible. 
To ensure we have the most competitive nominations, we encourage nominators to update 
their nomination each year when the Prize call is open.

***Selection Criteria and Judging Panel***

Each year, nominations for the BTM Willis Prize are judged by a sub-section of the NSG Committee. The judging panel base their evaluations on the overall quality of the relevant contributions and achievements of nominees, in relation to the following selection criteria:
*	Originality of research,
* Impact of research,
* Quality of publications, instrumentation, software, or patents,
* Innovation,
* Professional standing,
* Independence,
* Collaborations and teamwork,
* Other indicators of esteem indicated by the nominator and referee.

The scientific content of any supporting publications, as described in the supporting statements, is much more important than publication metrics or the identity of the journal in which it is published. The judging panel will also give greater priority to more recent and/or independent research, thus, supporting statements should focus on the nominee's more recent achievements.
Examples of relevant contributions of your nominee to the broader neutron scattering community could include, but are not limited to:
* Involvement with neutron scattering interest groups and committees,
* Teaching or demonstrating of neutron scattering sciences,
* Effective mentorship within the community and beyond,
* Service on boards, committees, or panels,
* Leadership in the scientific community,
* Peer reviewing,
* Promotion of equality, diversity, and inclusion,
* Advocacy for neutron scattering,
* Public engagement and outreach.

The members of the 2024 BTM Willis Judging Panel are: \
> Martin King, Royal Holloway University of London \
> Carla Andreani, University of Rome Tor Vergata \
> Dave Barlow, University of Manchester \
