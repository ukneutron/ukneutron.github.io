The group was formed in 1972 to provide a service to scientists interested in the use of neutron scattering .

The use of neutron scattering as a means of studying the structure and dynamics of systems has 
grown continuously since neutrons became available in reasonable quantities from research reactors 
and accelerator based sources Neutrons are now used for research in physics, chemistry, materials science, 
geology, archeology, catalysis, biology and engineering, both in the academic and industrial environments.  

In the UK the neutron scattering field has been extensively supported by provision of facilities at 
the [ISIS Neutron and Muon source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, 
funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council ([STFC](https://stfc.ukri.org/)). 
The UK is also major partner in the [Institut Laue-Langevin](https://www.ill.eu/) in Grenoble, France, 
which offers complementary instruments at a reactor source. In addition, the UK is funding and supporting 
the building of the European Spallation Source ([ESS](https://europeanspallationsource.se/)] in Lund, Sweden, 
which will be the most powerful spallation source world-wide once it comes online in 2023.

Due to the engagement in three major facilities, the NSG is representing the interest of 
UK users of scientific neutron radiation towards our own and international neutron sources, 
as well as ensures that UK science can be disseminated at national and international conferences. 
Another principal function of the Group is to disseminate information about the neutron 
facilities available to as wide an audience as possible, particularly to newer entrants 
to the field and to those who work in related subjects but who may wish to make use of 
neutron scattering techniques from time to time.
