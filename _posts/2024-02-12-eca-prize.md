The European Crystallographic Association (ECA) is pleased to announce a call for nominations for five different prizes:

- The thirteenth Max Perutz Prize. This prize will be awarded in recognition of meritorious achievements in any branch of crystallography to an individual scientist clearly affiliated with the ECA.  More information [here](https://ecanews.org/max-perutz-prize/).
- The eleventh Erwin Félix Lewy Bertaut Prize. This prize is awarded to a young scientist (up to 8 years after finishing her or his PhD thesis) having a clear affiliation with the ECA/ENSA region, in recognition of notable experimental, methodological or theoretical contributions to the investigation of matter using crystallographic or neutron scattering methods. The European Neutron Scattering Association (ENSA) and ECA award the Bertaut Prize in a regular alternating sequence, or as specified by the two associations based on mutual agreement. More information [here](https://ecanews.org/erwin-felix-lewy-bertaut-prize/).
- The third Alajos Kálmán Prize. This prize will be awarded to an individual researcher in recognition for outstanding scientific contributions in the field of structural sciences within the last 5-10 years. The nominee must have a clear affiliation with ECA. The prize has been established by the Hungarian Chemical Society and is endorsed by ECA.
