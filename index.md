<span style="color:green"> **The associate partners of the ILL (UK, France and Germany) have agreed to assure ILL operation till at least 2033.** </span>

For further information see the [Latest News on ILL Website](https://www.ill.eu/infos-presse-evenements/general-news/green-light-to-extend-ill-operations-until-2033) . 

We are proud to have played a small part in bringing this about and thank UK neutron community and our committee for your continuous support. 

[**UK NSG ILL Position Statement**](https://ukneutron.org/general/2024/03/25/ILL-Position-Statement/)

The Neutron Scattering Group is a group jointly hosted by Institute of Physics ([IOP](https://www.iop.org/physics-community/special-interest-groups/neutron-scattering-group)) and the Royal Society of Chemistry ([RSC](https://www.rsc.org/membership-and-community/connect-with-others/through-interests/interest-groups/neutron-scattering/)) to promote neutron science actively with its UK user community.
Our aims are to:
 
- Organise events to develop UK neutron user links and discuss results from neutron experiments
- Provide links to and from UK-funded neutron sources and the [European Neutron Scattering Association](http://www.neutrons-ensa.eu)
- Represent neutron scattering and its UK users within the IOP and RSC learned societies
- Support actively early career researchers in the UK to engage with neutron scattering
 
Our mission is to support and develop the UK neutron community in a rapidly changing global neutron landscape, and to represent UK neutron scattering externally.
Additionally, we award the [BTM Willis Prize](./willis), Don McKenzie Paul Thesis Prize and the Thomas-Penfold Poster Prize annually. 
Examples of activities include organising and contributing to conferences and schools involving neutron scattering research, e.g. the [Faraday Joint Interest Group Conferences](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/news/events/faraday2017/) in 2017, 2021 and 2023, the biennial [Oxford School on Neutron Scattering](https://www.oxfordneutronschool.org/) and  [early career researcher meetings](https://ukneutron.org/early_career/) in 2020 and 2022.
