The European Neutron Scattering Association (ENSA) has asked us to pass on information about a Neutron User Survay that will be used for BrightnESS2 and LENS to define the European neutron landscape for the coming years.

The necessary link - specific for UK neutron users - is here:

https://ensa.tudelft.nl/a81756_unitedkingdom

and the password for access is "ENSA_B2".

Members are encouraged to complete the survey (which takes around 10-15 mins) as soon as possible; preliminary findings from the survey are to be discussed at our next ENSA meeting on Sept 16th.
