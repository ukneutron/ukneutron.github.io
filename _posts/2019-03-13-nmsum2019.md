The UK Neutron and Muon Science and User Meeting (NMSUM) is jointly organised by ISIS and the ILL. It  is an opportunity for UK users of neutron and muon beams to know about the latest science done using these techniques, together with facility updates and other news of interest to the community. This is a great opportunity to neutron users to collaborate with fellow scientists in Universities and in these two facilities.  This annual meeting attracts hundreds of delegates each year. In 2018 about 300 scientists attended this meeting.
 
 
The meeting is free to attend for UK users. More information will be found [here](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/UK-Neutron-&-Muon-Science-and-User-Meeting-2019.aspx). 


The registration for NMSUM is now closed.
