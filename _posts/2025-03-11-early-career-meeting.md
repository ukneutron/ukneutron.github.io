The Neutron Scattering Group is hosting its biennial Early Career Meeting in 2025!

Dates: 21st and 22nd August, 2025
In-person event at Engineers House, Bristol

Researchers from any background and on any career path who use neutron scattering in any form are welcome to attend, as long as they are early in their career (within 12 years of award of their final degree). The meeting will consist of networking with fellow neutron scatterers, career development activities and oral presentations from the participants.
