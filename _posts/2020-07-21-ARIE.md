NSG members may be interested in the recently prepared ARIEs (Advanced Research Infrastructures in Europe) [position paper](./../../../../../assets/202007_ARIE-PosPaper_Pre-Release.pdf) on the future role and development of key resources (including synchrotron and neutron facility resources) for the five Horizon Europe Missions. 
This is a paper crafted with participation from several pan-European organisations, including the League of Advanced European Neutron Sources (LENS), the League of Accelerator-based Photon Sources (LEAPS), and the European Neutron Scattering Association (ENSA).
There is also an [associated press release](./../../../../../assets/Press_Release_09_07_2020.pdf) from Caterina Biscari, Chair of LEAPS.
