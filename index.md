The Neutron Scattering Group is a group jointly hosted by Institute of Physics ([IOP](https://www.iop.org/))  and the Royal Society of Chemistry ([RSC](https://www.rsc.org/)) to represent UK users of neutron scattering techniques within these learned societies. Additionally, we award the [BTM Willis Prize](./willis) and the Thomas-Penfold Prize annually. The Group is active in organising and contributing to conferences and schools involving neutron scattering research, e.g. the [Faraday Joint Interest Group Conference](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/chemistry/news/events/faraday2017/) in 2017, the [Gordon Research Conferences](https://www.grc.org/neutron-scattering-conference/) on Neutron Scattering 2018 and 2019, and the biennial [Oxford School on Neutron Scattering](https://www.oxfordneutronschool.org/).

We have about 500 members from 16 different countries around the world. 30% of our members are female. 

We work closely with the [Faraday Division](https://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/FaradayDivision/) of the RSc, as well as with other groups across the IOP & RSc, including those closely linked to the development of neutron sources, such as [Particle Accelerators and Beams groups](http://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/pab/). 

This website is still a work in progress but we are adding content as quickly as we can!
