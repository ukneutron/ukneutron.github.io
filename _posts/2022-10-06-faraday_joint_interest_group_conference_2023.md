The Neutron Scattering Group is meeting as part of the Royal Society of Chemistry Joint Interest Group meeting in Sheffield next spring (April 3-5 2023). Information on themes and plenary and keynote speakers is available on the [website](https://rsc.li/FJIG2023).

This meeting involves multiple parallel sessions and the sessions around Neutron Scattering are deliberately targeting any and all people who use neutrons in their science:

**Operando and In Situ Applications of Neutron Scattering:**

Generating insights from neutron scattering under demanding environments for controlled temperature, pressure, chemical environment, electrical/magnetic field, and for the study of functional materials under operational conditions."
The meeting promises to be an exciting and well-attended one, and we hope you will want to be part of it. If you would like to present your work, abstract submission is now open on the website so you can submit for consideration at any time -- the deadline for oral abstracts is 16 January 2023. I would also be grateful if you could spread the word among your colleagues.

Abstract submission now open. Submit you abstract [now](https://events.rsc.org/rsc/frontend/reg/tAbsSubmitterLogin.csp?pageID=918907&eventID=2625).
