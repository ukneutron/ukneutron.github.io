Nomination for BTM Willis Prize 2022 is now open. For more information see [here](https://ukneutron.org/general/2022/02/15/btm-willis-nom/)

The BTM Willis prize is named in honour of Prof. Terry Willis â€“ founder of the UK Neutron Scattering Group, and the well-known Harwell (later Oxford) School of Neutron Scattering. Since 2007, the IOP Neutron Scattering Group and the Faraday Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry award the prize annually to an early career researcher in recognition of a single outstanding piece of work, or a longer-term coherent body of work, in the application of neutron scattering to a significant problem in physics, chemistry, materials science, earth science, the life sciences, or engineering, or alternatively in recognition of a major development in neutron scattering instrumentation or techniques.

The prize is awarded to an individual in recognition of a single outstanding piece of work, or a longer term coherent body of work, in the application of neutron scattering to a significant problem in physics, chemistry, materials science, earth science, the life sciences, or engineering, or alternatively in recognition of a major development in neutron scattering instrumentation or techniques.

## Eligibility

The recipient of the prize will normally be an early career scientist, i.e. in the first 12 years of a research career (allowing for career breaks) following the award of a first degree, who has made a substantial contribution to the development or reputation of physics / Chemistry / Biology in the UK or Ireland.
